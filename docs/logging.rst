Logging
=======

When Tattle runs, it emits log messages about what it is doing. 

These logs can be found in ``$TATTLE_HOME/var/log/tattle.log``

Levels
-------

The default setup for logging is to log only ``WARN`` messages and below.  You can turn on ``debug`` if you wish by editing ``$TATTLE_HOME/etc/tattle/logging.yaml`` and changing the level.
